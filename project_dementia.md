## Abstract

People with dementia (PwD) often present verbal agitation such as cursing, screaming, and persistently complaining. Verbal agitation can impose mental distress on informal caregivers (e.g., family, friends), which may cause severe mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety disorders. To improve informal caregivers' mental health, we explore design opportunities by interviewing 11 informal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation of PwD. In particular, we first characterize how the predictability of verbal agitation impacts informal caregivers' mental health and how caregivers' coping strategies vary before, during, and after verbal agitation. Based on our findings, we propose design opportunities to improve the mental health of informal caregivers suffering from verbal agitation: distracting PwD (in-situ support; before), prompting just-in-time maneuvers (information support; during), and comfort and education (social \& information support; after). We discuss our reflections on cultural disparities between participants. Our work envisions a broader design space for supporting informal caregivers' well-being and describes when and how that support could be provided.

## Design Framework

<div class="ui" align="center">
	<img src="./assets/lily_ui.png" width="80%">
</div>

(A) is the initial user interface of our system. It shows where the recommendations would appear by displaying three blank oval shapes. (B) shows users’ typing input and three recommended lines of romantic song lyrics. (C) shows the randomized results of our system. Even if users type the same words, it will not always return the exact same lines.

</div>

The overview of our system framework. (a) Once a user receives a message(M<sub>1</sub>) from his/her partner, (b) the user types some phrases(*r<sub>1</sub>*) to reply in the input line. (c) Then the system reads the phrases(*r<sub>1</sub>*). (d) The system then returns three corresponding lines(*l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3</sub>*) of lyrics. (e) The lines(*l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3</sub>*) are presented on the chat UI so that (f) the user can refer to them(*l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3</sub>*) to refine their response(*R<sub>1</sub>*) before sending it.

## Usage example

<div class="ui" align="center">
	<img src="/assets/lily_example.png" width="80%">
</div>

P3 and P4 are in a relationship. On the second day of the experiment, P4 asked P3 a question during the chat, *‘Which one do you prefer? short hair or long hair?’*. In the context of typing a response to the this question, P3 was inspired by the recommendations provided. The figure illustrates the whole process which P3 followed to enrich his response.
